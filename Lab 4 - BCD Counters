1. Getting familiar with the 7-segment display and switches on the FPGA board with the
counter designs.
2. Getting familiar with finite-state machines (FSM) in Verilog.
3. Every signal connected to the push button (except the reset signal) should be properly
processed with the debouncing and/or one-pulse converters.
